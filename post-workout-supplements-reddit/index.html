But the secret to building muscles and keep your gains going well after your workout is that you need to supply your body with nutrients for growth and recovery with post workout supplements. Im actually starting to become competitive in CrossFit and working out for 3-4 hours 5 days a week. And I can see where the question comes from since my three most popular products Pre JYM Pro JYM and Post. Weve looked into some of the most popular post-workout supplements and provided you with 10 of the top options to get you started. Pin On Big Muscle Training.</p>

Was more just wondering about post workout supps to help with recovery intra workout. Progenex Recovery is more of a protein shake that it is a true post-workout supplement. Anyone here know or have. Recovery is not in post workout supplements its in taking quality rest.
