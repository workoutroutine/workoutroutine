<p><strong>Should You Workout Two Days In A Row</strong>, Yes its possible to train more often but your performance will suffer on that third workout. If you end up doing the same exercises 2 days in a row mix up the volume and intensity those days to make sure it doesnt kill you. I would recommend that each day is entirely different and that you focus on entirely different muscle groups avoiding any exercises.</p>

<p>To put your body in the best possible position to perform them at a high level every training session its best not to train more than two days in a row. I would run 2 days at 1 to 15k each take a couple days off. You CAN train the same muscle group two days in a row.
