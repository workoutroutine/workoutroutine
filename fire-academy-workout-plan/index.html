<p>The first group of workouts that I want to talk about are those that relate to our work as firefighters. This workout plan is comprised of four sessions per week and you should give yourself a minimum of six weeks training before test day. The tests and examinations that are set during your time there are not optional. 7 weeks 5 daysweek. There are different exercises that we can add to our workout plan that will help our performance.
